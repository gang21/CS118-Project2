- This congestion control design utilizes dynamic batch sizes with AIMD and stop-and-wait protocol
- it begins with a window size of 1 and increases at a rate of cwnd + (1/cwnd) for every correct sequence of acks 
- if there is a collision/acks are out of order, the window size will decrease by a factor of cwnd/2 
- for a given window size n, the client will send out n packets and wait for the n acks in order
- if the acks are not received or are received out of order, the client will resend the packets
